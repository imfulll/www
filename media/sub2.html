                  Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born on May 29, 1970, in
                  Manhattan, New York to Howard Stark, a famous genius inventor
                  and businessman, and Maria Stark, a socialite and
                  philanthropist. Growing up under the eye of family butler
                  Edwin Jarvis, his life was characterized by a cold and
                  affectionless relationship with his father.
